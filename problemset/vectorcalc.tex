\section*{About the Document}
This document was originally designed in the spring of 2015 to guide students
through an eleven week Linear Algebra course (Math 211, Linear Algebra for Scientists) at
the University of Victoria.  The order of topics closely follows that in {\it Linear
Algebra for Science and Engineering} second edition by Daniel Norman and Dan Wolczuk.

A typical class day using the problem-sets:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item {\bf Introduction by instructor.} This may involve giving a definition,
		a broader context for the day's topics, or answering questions.
	\item {\bf Students work on problems.} Students work individually or in pairs
		on the prescribed problem.  During this time the instructor moves around
		the room addressing questions that students may have and giving one-on-one
		coaching.
	\item {\bf Instructor intervention.} If most students have successfully solved the 
		problem, the instructor regroups the class by providing a concise 
		explanation so that everyone is ready to move to the next concept.  This
		is also time for the instructor to ensure that everyone has understood the
		main point of the exercise (since it is sometimes easy to do some computation
		while being oblivious to the larger context).

		If students are having trouble, the instructor can give hints to the group,
		and additional guidance to ensure the students don't get frustrated
		to the point of giving up.
	\item {\bf Repeat step 2.}
\end{enumerate}

Using this format, students are working (and happily so) most of the class.
Further, they are especially primed to hear the insights of the instructor, 
having already invested substantially into each problem.


These problem-sets strike a balance between concepts and computation, leaning towards
the conceptual side.  Two algorithms, \emph{row reduction} and \emph{determinant of
a matrix by cofactors}, are not introduced in these problem-sets.  Instead, students are
expected to learn them on their own and be prepared to apply them on problems in the
problem-set (these topics were left up to the students because of time constraints).
Further, not ever Linear Algebra definition is given in these problem-sets, since these
notes are not intended to replace a Linear Algebra textbook, but most definitions
are given to expedite the transition to new topics in the middle of class time.

	Notice that all arrows in this diagram are the same length.
	We will call this length a \emph{unit}.
	\begin{Enum}
		\item Give directions from $\bf o$ to $p$ of
		the form ``Walk \ul units in the direction of arrow \ul, then 
		walk \ul units in the direction of arrow \ul.''

		\item Can you give directions from $\bf o$ to $q$ using $\bf c$ and $\bf a$?
		Give such directions, or explain why it cannot be done.

	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{.65\textwidth}
	We are going to start using a more mathematical notation
	for giving directions.  Our directions will now look like
	\[
		p = \ull\, \xh + \ull\, \yh
	\]
	which is read as ``To get to $p$ (=) go \ul units in the direction $\xh$ then (+) go \ul units in 
	the direction $\yh$.''

	\begin{Enum}
		\item What is the difference between $p = \ull\, \xh + \ull\, \yh$ and $p = \ull\, \yh + \ull\, \xh$?
		Can they both give valid directions?
		\item
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Give directions to $p$ using the new notation. 
			\item Give directions to $p$ using $\bf c$.
			\item What is the distance from $\bf o$ to $p$ in units?
		\end{enumerate}
		\item
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $r=1\bf c$.  Give directions from $\bf o$ to $r$ using $\xh$ and $\yh$.
			\item What is the distance from $\bf o$ to $r$?
		\end{enumerate}
		\item
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $q=-2\xh+3\yh$; find the exact distance from $\bf o$ to $q$.
			\item $s=2\xh+\bf c$; find the exact distance from $\bf o$ to $s$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{Enum}
	\end{minipage}


	The vectors $\xh$ and $\yh$ are called the \emph{standard
	basis vectors} for $\R^2$ (the plane).  

\section*{Column Vector Notation}
	We previously wrote $q=-2\xh+3\yh$.  In column vector notation we write
	\[
		q=\begin{bmatrix}-2\\3\end{bmatrix}
	\]
	We may call $q$ either a \emph{vector} or a \emph{point}.  If we call $q$ a vector,
	we are emphasizing that $q$ gives direction of some sort.  If we call $q$ a point,
	we emphasize that $q$ is some absolute location in space. (What's the philosophical
	difference between a location in space and directions from the origin to said location?)

	\sep 
	$r=1\bf c$ and $s=2\xh+\bf c$ where $\bf c$ is the vector from before.
	\begin{Enum}
		\item Write $r$ and $s$ in column vector form.
	\end{Enum}

\section*{Sets and Set Notation}

	\begin{Def}
		A \emph{set} is a (possibly infinite) collection of items
		and is notated with curly braces (for example, $\{1,2,3\}$ is
		the set containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3).  We call the items in
		a set \emph{elements}.

		If $X$ is a set and $a$ is an element $X$, we may write $a\in X$,
		which is read ``$a$ is an element of $X$.''

		If $X$ is a set, a \emph{subset} $Y$ of $X$ (written $Y\subseteq X$)
		is a set such that every element of $Y$ is an element of $X$.

		We can define a subset using \emph{set-builder notation}.
		That is, if $X$ is a set, we can define the subset 
		\[
			Y= \{a\in X:\text{some rule involving }a\},
		\]
		which is read ``$Y$ is the set of $a$ in $X$ {\bf such that} some rule
		involving $a$ is true.''  If $X$ is intuitive, we may omit it and
		simply write $Y=\{a:\text{some rule involving }a\}$.  You may equivalently
		use ``$|$'' instead of ``$:$'', writing $Y=\{a\,|\,\text{some rule involving }a\}$.
	\end{Def}

	\begin{Def}
		Some common sets are
		\vspace{-1em}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] $\N=\{\text{natural numbers}\} = \{\text{non-negative whole numbers}\}$.
			\item[] $\Z=\{\text{integers}\} = \{\text{whole numbers, including negatives}\}$.
			\item[] $\R=\{\text{real numbers}\}$.
			\item[] $\R^n=\{\text{vectors in $n$-dimensional Euclidean space}\}$.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{Def}

	\sep
	\vspace{-2em}
	\begin{Enum}
		\item Which of the following are true?
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $3\in\{1,2,3\}$.
			\item $4\in\{1,2,3\}$.
			\item ``b''$\in\{x:x\text{ is an English letter}\}$.
			\item ``\`o''$\in\{x:x\text{ is an English letter}\}$.
			\item $\{1,2\}\subseteq \{1,2,3\}$.
			\item For some $a\in\{1,2,3\}$, $a \geq 3$.
			\item For any $a\in\{1,2,3\}$, $a\geq 3$.
			\item $1\subseteq\{1,2,3\}$.
			\item $\{1,2,3\}=\{x\in\R:1\leq x\leq 3\}$.
			\item $\{1,2,3\}=\{x\in\Z:1\leq x\leq 3\}$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{Enum}

	\sep
		Write the following in set-builder notation
	\begin{Enum}
			\item The subset $A\subseteq \R$ of real numbers larger than $\sqrt{2}$.
			\item The subset $B\subseteq \R^2$ of vectors whose first coordinate
			is twice the second.
	\end{Enum}

	\begin{Def}
		Two common set operations are \emph{unions} and \emph{intersections}.  
		Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets.

		\hfill\begin{minipage}{\dimexpr\textwidth-3cm}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[(union)] $X\cup Y = \{a:a\in X\text{ or }a\in Y\}$.
			\item[(intersection)] $X\cap Y = \{a: a\in X\text{ and }a\in Y\}$.
		\end{itemize}
		\end{minipage}
	\end{Def}

	\sep
	Let $X=\{1,2,3\}$ and $Y=\{2,3,4,5\}$ and $Z=\{4,5,6\}$.  Compute
	\begin{Enum}
		\item $X\cup Y$
		\item $X\cap Y$
		\item $X\cup Y\cup Z$
		\item $X\cap Y\cap Z$
	\end{Enum}

	\sep
	Draw the following subsets of $\R^2$.
	\begin{Enum}
		\item $V=\left\{\vec x\in\R^2:\vec x=\begin{bmatrix}0\\t\end{bmatrix}\text{ for some }t\in\R\right\}$.
		\item $H=\left\{\vec x\in\R^2:\vec x=\begin{bmatrix}t\\0\end{bmatrix}\text{ for some }t\in\R\right\}$.

		\item $V\cup H$.
		\item $V\cap H$.
		\item Does $V\cup H=\R^2$?
	\end{Enum}



\section*{Dot Product}
	\vspace{-1cm}

	\begin{Def}
	If $\vec a=\begin{bmatrix}a_1\\ a_2\\ \vdots \\ a_n\end{bmatrix}$ and 
	$\vec b=\begin{bmatrix}b_1\\ b_2\\ \vdots \\ b_n\end{bmatrix}$ are two vectors in $n$-dimensional
		space, then the \emph{dot product} of $\vec a$ an $\vec b$ is
	\[
		\vec a\cdot\vec b = a_1b_1+a_2b_2+\cdots+a_nb_n.
	\]
	Equivalently, the dot product is defined by the geometric formula
	\[
		\vec a\cdot \vec b = \|\vec a\|\|\vec b\|\cos \theta
	\]
	where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec a$ and $\vec b$.
	\end{Def}
	
	\pagebreak
	\sep
		Let $\vec a=\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\end{bmatrix}$, $\vec b=\begin{bmatrix}3\\2\end{bmatrix}$, and $\vec u=\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\1\end{bmatrix}$.
	\vspace{-.5cm}
	\begin{Enum}
		\item 
		\begin{enumerate}	
			\item Draw a picture of $\vec a $ and $\vec b$.
			\item Compute $\vec a\cdot \vec b$.
			\item Find $\|\vec a\|$ and $\|\vec b\|$ and use your knowledge of
			the multiple ways to compute the dot product to find $\theta$,
			the angle between $\vec a$ and $\vec b$. Label $\theta$ on your picture.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item Draw the graph of $\cos$ and identify which angles make $\cos$ negative, zero,
		or positive.

		\item Draw a new picture of $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ and on that picture draw
		\begin{enumerate}	
			\item a vector $\vec c$ where $\vec c\cdot \vec a$ is negative.
			\item a vector $\vec d$ where $\vec d\cdot \vec a=0$ and $\vec d\cdot \vec b < 0$.
			\item a vector $\vec e$ where $\vec e\cdot \vec a=0$ and $\vec e\cdot \vec b>0$.
			\item Could you find a vector $\vec f$ where $\vec f\cdot \vec a=0$ and $\vec f\cdot \vec b=0$?
			Explain why or why not.
		\end{enumerate}

		\item Recall the vector $\vec u$ whose coordinates are given at the beginning of this problem.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Write down a vector $\vec v$ so that the angle between $\vec u$ and $\vec v$
			is $\pi/2$. (Hint, how does this relate to the dot product?)
			\item Write down another vector $\vec w$ (in a different direction from $\vec v$)
			so that the angle between $\vec w$ and $\vec u$ is $\pi/2$.
			\item Can you write down other vectors different than both $\vec v$ and $\vec w$ that still
			form an angle of $\pi/2$ with $\vec u$?  How many such vectors are there?
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{Enum}

	\vspace{-.7cm}
	\begin{Def}
		The \emph{norm} of a vector $\vec v\in\R^n$, denoted $\|\vec v\|$ is its length
		and is given by the formula
		\[
			\|\vec v\| = \sqrt{\vec v\cdot\vec v}.
		\]
	\end{Def}

			and using the formula from the definition of the norm.  How do
			these quantities relate?
		\item Let $\vec b = \mat{1\\1\\-2\\2}$, and find $\|\vec b\|$.
		Did you know how to find 4-d lengths before?
	
		\item Suppose $\vec u=\mat{x\\ y}$ for some $x,y\in \R$.
		Could $\vec u\cdot \vec u$ be negative? Compute $\vec u\cdot \vec u$ algebraically

\section*{Projections}

\subsection*{A New Perspective on Derivatives}

	In single-variable calculus, we deal with functions $g:\R\to\R$.  The derivative of this function

\newpage

	\begin{Def}
		The \emph{directional derivative} of a function $f:\R^n\to\R^m$ at the

	So far, the gradient has been appearing in directional derivatives and tangent planes.

		If no such $L$ exists, we say the limit does not exist.

\subsection*{The Volume Form}
	We've been using integrals to find the area or volume (or hypervolume) under a curve.
	Abstractly, this process has been the same every time: chop the region into little pieces, and
	add up each piece's contribution with an integral to find the total.  We're continuing the same
	process, but we're going to start chopping regions up into (sometimes) non-rectangular chunks.

			be small.  Write down a formula for the area enclosed by those curves.  Does your
			formula depend on $r_0$ and $\theta_0$?

		at the point $(a,b)$ is written $\Delta V(a,b)$ and is the area between the curves
		$a=a_0$, $a=a_0+\Delta a$, $b=b_0$, and $b=b_0+\Delta b$.

	Let $A$ be a matrix with eigenvalues $\{\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_m\}$.  The

	The \emph{geometric multiplicity} of an eigenvalue $\lambda_i$ is the dimension
	of the eigenspace corresponding to $\lambda_i$.  The \emph{algebraic multiplicity}
	of $\lambda_i$ is the number of times $\lambda_i$ occurs as a root of the

	Orthogonal matrices also allow us to compute projections quite easily.

	\begin{Def}
		If $V$ is a subspace of $\R^n$, the \emph{projection}
		(sometimes called the orthogonal projection) of $\vec x$ onto $V$
		is the closest point in $V$ to $\vec x$. We notate the projection
		of $\vec x$ onto $V$ as $\proj_V\vec x$.
	\end{Def}

	Projections are normally hard to compute and a priori might require some sort
	of calculus-style optimization to find.  However, from geometry we know that 
	if we travel from $\proj_V \vec x$ to $\vec x$, we should always trace out a path
	perpendicular to $V$.  Otherwise, we could find a point in $V$ that was slightly closer
	to $\vec x$, violating the definition of $\proj_V \vec x$.  Thus, orthogonality
	will be our savior.

\subsection*{Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization}
	We've seen how useful orthonormal bases are.  The incredible thing is that we can 
	turn any basis into an orthonormal basis through a process called
	Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization.

	\sep

	\begin{Enum}
		\item Draw $\vec a$ and $\vec b$ and find $\vec w=\proj_{\vec b}\vec a$.
		\item Add $\vec c=\vec a-\vec w$ to your drawing.  What is the angle between
			$\vec c$ and $\vec b$.
		\item Can you write $\vec a$ as the sum of two vectors, one in 
			the direction of $\vec b$ and one orthogonal to $\vec b$?
			If so, do it.

	Let $\vec a=\mat{1\\2\\6}$ and $\vec b=\mat{1\\1\\-1}$.
	\begin{Enum}
		\item Write $\vec a=\vec u+\vec v$ where $\vec u$ is parallel to
			$\vec b$ and $\vec v$ is orthogonal to $\vec b$.
		\item Find an orthonormal basis for $\span\{\vec a,\vec b\}$.
	\end{Enum}

	With two vectors, making an orthonormal set without changing the span
	is quite easy.  With more vectors, it is only slightly harder.

	\begin{Def}
		The \emph{Gram-Schmidt} orthogonalization procedure
		takes in a set of vectors and outputs a set of orthonormal vectors
		with the same span.  The idea is to iteratively produce a set of
		vectors where each new vector you produce is orthogonal to the previous vectors.

		The algorithm is as follows: Let $\{ v_1,\ldots, v_n\}$ be a set of 
		vectors.  Produce a set $\{ v_2',\ldots, v_n'\}$ that is orthogonal
		to $ v_1$ by subtracting off the respective projections
		of $ v_2,\ldots, v_n$
		onto $ v_1$.  Next, produce a set $\{ v_3'',\ldots, v_n''\}$
		orthogonal to both $ v_1$ and $ v_2'$ by subtracting off the
		respective projections
		onto $ v_2'$.  Continue this process until you have a set
		$V=\{ v_1, v_2', v_3'', v_4''',\ldots\}$ that is orthogonal.
		Finally, normalize $V$ so all vectors have unit length.

\subsection*{$QR$ Decomposition}

	\begin{Def}

			q_3' &= \vec v_3-\vec v_1+2\vec v_2

	form an orthogonal set.  Normalizing we get
	\[

			\vec q_1 &= 2q_1'\\
			\vec q_2 &= 3q_2'\\
			\vec q_3 &=\frac{1}{2}q_3'

	Define $A=[\vec v_1|\vec v_2|\vec v_2]$ and $Q=[\vec q_1|\vec q_2|\vec q_3]$.
	\begin{Enum}[resume]
		\item Find a matrix $R$ so that $A=QR$.
	\end{Enum}
	
	We've just discovered one process to find the $QR$ decomposition of a matrix.
	It's really as simple as doing Gram-Schmidt and keeping track of your coefficients.
	Now, we have another way to the matrix equation $A\vec x=\vec b$.  If we do a $QR$
	decomposition and exploit the fact that $Q^{-1}=Q^T$, we have
	\[
		A\vec x=QR\vec x=\vec b\qquad\implies\qquad R\vec x=Q^T\vec b
	\]
	and $R$ is a triangular matrix, so we can just do back substitution! (It turns
	out that if you solve systems this way, there is less rounding error than if you
	use row reduction.)

\subsection*{Symmetric Matrices}
	When you're new to Linear Algebra, learning lots of new concepts and algorithms,
	it's sometimes hard to grasp the significance of certain properties of a matrix.

	Symmetric matrices are easy to forget at first, but they have many profound 
	properties (not to mention they are one of the key concepts of Quantum Mechanics).

	\sep
	Let $A$ be a symmetric matrix and let $\vec v$ be an eigenvector with eigenvalue
	3 and $\vec w$ be an eigenvector with eigenvalue 4.  Note, for this problem,
	we are thinking of $\vec v$ and $\vec w$ as column vectors.
	\begin{Enum}
		\item Write $A\vec v$, $\vec v^TA^T$, $\vec v^TA$, $A\vec w$, $\vec w^TA^T$, 
		and $\vec w^TA$ in terms of $\vec v$, $\vec w$ and scalars.
		\item How do $\vec v^T\vec w$ and $\vec w^T\vec v$ relate?
		\item What should $\vec v^TA\vec w$ be in terms of $\vec v^T$ and
			$\vec w$? (Note, you could compute $(\vec v^TA)\vec w$
			or $\vec v^T(A\vec w)$.  Better do both to be safe).
		\item What can you conclude about $\vec v^T\vec w$?  How about
			$\vec v\cdot \vec w$?
	\end{Enum}

	We've just deduced that all eigenspaces of a symmetric matrix are orthogonal! On
	top of that, symmetric matrices always have a basis of eigenvectors.  That means
	that not only can you always diagonalize a symmetric matrix, but you can 
	\emph{orthogonally} diagonalize a symmetric matrix. (i.e. if $A$ is symmetric,
	then $A=QDQ^T$ where $Q$ is orthogonal and $D$ is diagonal).  This is like the 
	best of all worlds in one!
