# IBLVectorCalculus

Worksheet problems for an inquiry-based Vector Calculus course.
The problems in the `problemset` folder were primarily worked on in class.
These problems were designed while teaching an honors section of
Vector Calculus.  They start with vectors, representations of lines
and planes, and notation, and then move onto tangent planes,
gradients, vector fields, and finally Stokes' theorem.
